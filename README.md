Hey y'all, I'm lrny-lru! 👋




  🌌I have a science degree and a background in research psychology along with experience in clinical and behavioral neuropsychology.
  
  💻I'm working/learning in JavaScript, jQuery, and soon, React.
  
  🎒 I'm a full stack engineer or design developer to some, depends on who you ask.
  
  🧐 I'm interested in patterns and the different ways to think about languages as you learn them.
  
  🎨 I've been a practicing artist for ~25 years & a professional for the last 5 years. 
  
  🏢 I'm in coding bootcamp (⌐■_■)
  
  ⛺ I live in North Carolina.
  
  💬 tweet at me if you like discussing all the different ways to think about information or you just enjoy being silly & absurd? @lrnlru
